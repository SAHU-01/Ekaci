## Details
The <b>Government of Odisha </b>has enrolled multiple farmers across the state under the <b>Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY)</b> this year. The number of enrollments has been increasing every year and the Government hopes <b>to reach more farmers in a short time</b>. 

Even though the scheme has been designed to be pro-farmer, there have been <b>operational issues in the field</b>. One such challenging problem is the <b>delayed settlement of insurance claims</b> and their rejection by insurance companies. Insurance companies are yet to clear <b>almost 33 percent of estimated claims</b> to the framers who come under the PMFBY.  Due to these issues the state has witnessed farmer agitations about the lack of clarity in the settlement and <b>disbursement of insurance claims</b>.
